# Server Calculator

## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

I created a calculator that calculates in the server and displays results on the DOM. I used a POST request to gather information from HTML inputs via the client file and calculate the results in the server. I used a GET request to display the results from the array in the server file to the DOM via the client. To determine which operator to use, I made an object that can be altered by the functions attached to the HTML buttons that is then read in the function made to send the POST request in the client file.
